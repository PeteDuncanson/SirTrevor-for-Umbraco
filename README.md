##Download: Ready to use as an Umbraco Package
You can [download](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/backoffice-extensions/value-duplicator "Download the Package") Value Duplicator as a ready to use Umbraco package and plug it into your site easily. The package installer only adds a dashboard item to the "Settings" section, so the risk of wrecking your CMS installation extremely low.
