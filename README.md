SirTrevor for Umbraco 7+
============================

![Sir Trevor for Umbraco in action](https://raw.github.com/madebymany/sir-trevor-js/master/examples/sir-trevor.gif)

Based on [Sir Trevor](http://madebymany.github.io/sir-trevor-js/). From [mindrevolution](http://www.mindrevolution.com) for [Umbraco](http://www.umbraco.org) with love. Maintained by [Marc St√∂cker](https://twitter.com/esn303).



## Quick start

This Umbraco plugin package is for Umbraco 7 and the new "Belle UI".

### Umbraco package installation
Install the [package](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/) from the Umbraco package repository.

### Manual installation
Add [/src/App_Plugins/SirTrevor](https://github.com/mindrevolution/SirTrevor-for-Umbraco/tree/master/App_Plugins/SirTrevor) to your Umbraco 7 website.

### Customize the image block size
By default a size reduced thumbnail of the image is inserted into the editor. This makes drag and drop for the blocks much easier on many screens, especially wide, hi-res ones. You can remove this limit by tweaking [umbraco-backend.css](https://github.com/mindrevolution/SirTrevor-for-Umbraco/blob/master/App_Plugins/SirTrevor/umbraco-backend.css).

### Extend Sir Trevor
Full documentation for Sir Trevor can be found [here](http://madebymany.github.io/sir-trevor-js/docs.html).



## Updating the Sir Trevor library
In case you want to upgrade your installation to a later Sir Trevor build than this package supports out of the box, the library is located in [App_Plugins/SirTrevor/lib/](https://github.com/mindrevolution/SirTrevor-for-Umbraco/tree/master/App_Plugins/SirTrevor/lib) and can be upgraded easily, no modifications necessary.
